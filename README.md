#### My first foray into the world of web AR. My name is Christopher Caswell. I'm a workhorse looking for his cart. In this endeavor, I am looking to do anything and everything involving a language. This project was a good way to get started in the world of browser based AR before tackling the next major scene.

#### The singular intent of this project is to place a model on an AR plane that is mapped to the real world.

#### This project is mostly sourced through the [three.js library and resources](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html), which allows for the creation of 3D objects and planes.

#### The process for using this repo is as simple as pointing and clicking. You will have to allow your phone to access your camera and your brain access to puppy-based joy.

#### The model used is based on ["Shiba"](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/shiba-faef9fe5ace445e7b2989d1c1ece361c) by [zixisun02](https://sketchfab.com/dogerlo) licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

> implemented features:
>> AR plane detection<br>
>> AR plane rendering<br>
>> model specificity<br>

> stretch goals:
>> mobilize the model<br>
>> add UI to control/alter the plane<br>
>> add UI to select the model<br>

All you really need to get started is a modern browser on a phone or tablet. Go to [this link](https://christopher-caswell.github.io/WebAR) to play around.
